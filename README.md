# rust-shit
fucking rust idk its a thing different than java im stupid cant learn things im doing my best I should be doing other stuff rn probably but here we are fml

a lot differenter than java i guess damn this is going to be difficult

if for some fucking reason some poor soul stubles across this depressing excuse for self taught programming:
feel free to make a pull request offering improvments to what I am doing and how I should think about things differently
or alter my coding style.
